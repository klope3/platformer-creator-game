## Credits
This project was built with React, TypeScript, and Phaser. The Kyoobo character and several other assets were created by Emcee Flesher on Opengameart.org. See the assets [here](https://opengameart.org/content/tofuman-platformer-character-and-world).
## How It Started
This game was my capstone project for the Devslopes Web Academy. Because it was well-received, and because I had so much fun making it, Iâ€™ve decided to continue development, and see if I can pick up a few interested real players along the way.
## Future Plans
I have many features in mind for future development, and I'll get to them when I have the time and resources. Here are a few:
- Integrated level editor (users will be able to make their own levels)
- More enemy variety
- More level variety
- Sound effects and music
- Powerups
- Comment sections
- Profile pictures
- Mobile responsiveness
